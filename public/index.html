          I'm David, a software engineer who is passionate about TypeScript, AWS (especially serverless technologies), 
          observability, and React. I'm currently working at <a href="https://www.cinch.co.uk">cinch</a>, an online 
          car retailer, as a full-stack engineer.

            </div>
            <p>
              I've spent my time at cinch working in an agile, multidisciplinary team on both front-end (Gatsy, Next.js, React)
              and serverless back-end (AWS) typescript projects. This has been a fantasic opportunity to gain experience in both new
              technologies, and methodologies. I've learnt a lot around observability, cloud, serverless architectures, 
              infrastructure-as-code and pair/mob programming.

              <h3>Blueprint Gaming</h3>
              <span>Oct 2010 - Feb 2022</span>
            </div>
            <p>
              Blueprint gave me a wide variety of experience across a lot of different technologies and roles. 
              Over my years there, I went from developing native mobile games, to web based games, and spent several 
              years leading a small team of developers working on internal libraries and tooling to make the lives 
              of the game developers easier.
            </p>
            <p>
              This involved a variety of tools and languages, and while working on the internal libraries, I discovered
              a love of TypeScript and React, as well as leading initiatives to migrate the company from their existing SVN
              version control system to git, and implement CI/CD pipelines.
